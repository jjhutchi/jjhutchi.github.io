[The Impact of Easing Stay at Home Orders on US Businesses](/pdf/sah-removal-covid.pdf)

This paper explores human mobility responses to city-level reopenings for a sample of US cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the use of cellphone tracking and business financial data, I employ a variety of reduced form econometric techniques to estimate how the general US population responded to city level stay at home order re- movals. I observe modest responses in visiting patterns to essential industries following the removal of stay at home orders, and with larger impacts at industries deemed to be either semi-essential or non-essential. Industry specific models suggest mobility pat- terns shifting towards industries more prone to spread the COVID-19 virus. Further, I find there to be a strong increase in small business revenue following the removal of stay at home orders.

[Does Yelp impact where we choose to eat?](/pdf/SFU-Yelp-thesis.pdf)

This study estimates the effect Yelp ratings have on restaurant attendance. The novelty of this paper lies in the sense that it estimates the impact of each individual rating received by the restaurant. A natural experiment is used to overcome the si- multaneity problem associated with measuring the impact ratings have on restaurant performance. A 2SLS IV empirical strategy is employed using Yelpers who exclusively provide low ratings as an exogenous shock to restaurants. Results show each incremen- tal star rating is responsible for a 13% increase in ratings received by the restaurant in the subsequent week. Estimates can be expected to be as large as 20% based on restaurant area density. Ultimately, this study finds Yelp to be a mechanism used to overcome the information asymmetry with consumption decisions.
